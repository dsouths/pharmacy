<h1> Pharmacy4u website - ReadMe</h1>

![Responsiveness - Pharmacy4u](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181626573-3aeaf79a-c57d-45ff-8c83-b01c370bc551.jpg)


<p> 

I have created a pharmacy website (Pharmacy4u) that can be used by multiple pharmacies with simple modifications e.g. pharmacy name, logo, location details, etc. It gives basic background information about the pharmacy & enables the user to order prescriptions, book an online consultation & get some information about the pharmacy. I have designed it to be user friendly, visually appealing to the user & to create a positive emotional response by the user with a complimentary color palette & clickable buttons to name a few examples.  The site is targeted at current customers of the pharmacy who wish to improve their level of communication by ordering prescriptions or booking online consultations via the website & also prospective customers that may not be aware of the pharmacy, thus helping to improve it's online profile.  

The aim of the website is to:

- clearly indicate the purpose of the website to the user
- improve the online presence of the pharmacy by creating an interactive website
- enable the user to contact the pharmacy via for specific reasons e.g. order prescription, book consultation forms
- enable user to easily email the pharmacy by including a clickable email link in the footer
- utilise skills I have developed in learning two languages CSS & HTML. 
- have a simple layout the user can easily navigate
- include links to the pharmacies social media 

I plan to make the site accessable on a range of screen sizes for devices e.g. phone, tablet & PC/Laptop.

<h1>Features</h1>

<h3> Navigation Bar</h3>
    
<p>

I have made this easy to navigate between each page with a simple nav bar of four selections:
	
- Home
- About Us
- Prescriptions
- Book Consultation

	


![Pharmacy4u - Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181624487-16f6e240-5aa4-4de9-87c8-5fbb86c0c320.jpg)



I have ensured the nav bar is consistant among all of the pages to ensure continuity on the website. I have colored these in contrast to the background to make them stand out. I have also employed a hover function that underlines the link & signifies a call to action for the user.

</p>

<h3>Landing Page</h3>

![Pharmacy4u - Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105642587/181624599-f87f7934-0ecd-450c-b4ec-e3ebc9bf5578.jpg)

I have used an image of tablets in a cup to convey to the user this website is a pharmacy website. I have used the zoom in function, like in the love running project, as I believe the dynamic image creates interest to the user making the website more appealing, which is vitally important on a landing page.

I have created two styled, clickable buttons for ordering prescriptions & booking a consultation. I have made these very visible to convey to the user the purpose of the website & to improve navigation for the user. I have styled these & created an action when clicked to emulate pressing a button which I believe will create an emotional response of satisfaction, be it small, but still creating satisfaction to the user. 
	
I have created a fixed footer & a unfixed footer & will discuss later. 

</p>

<h3>About Us Section</h3>

<p>
I have written a short paragraph detailing the owner of the pharmacy, their experience & where the pharmacy is located. This is to give the user some insight into the owner of the pharmacy & create trust in using the pharmacy. 
	
I have created the "About Us" page that gives the user information about the pharmacy. 

</p>

<h3>Prescriptions</h3>

<p> 
This section enables the user to fill out a form to request a prescription from the pharmacy. The user must fill out their credentials name, phone number, email address & comments/details. It also allows the user to inform the pharmacy if it is a prescription they retain on file or if it is a new prescription it offers the user the ability to upload a picture of the prescription to the pharmacy.  I have used the "required" attribute to ensure the necessary information is filled in   
</p>

<h3>Book Consultation</h3>

<p> 

This section enables the user to fill out a form to request a consultation from the pharmacy. I have included a few common ailments a pharmacist would normally advise on but have also included an "other" section with a input to allow "free typing" if the user wishes to book consultation for another reason not listed. Again the user must fill out their credentials name, phone number, email address & comments/details. 

</p>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

I decided on Roboto Condensed & Sans-Serif as complimentary fonts for the headings & main body of the site. I chose these fonts as they are readable & clean for the user. I used Italianno for the H3 heading for the tag line for the pharmacy "where good health begins" as I thought it gave the tag line more character & meaning to the user.
