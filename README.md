<h1> Pharmacy4u website - ReadMe</h1>

<p> 
    I have made a pharmacy website (Pharmacy4u) that can be used by multiple pharmacies with simple modifications e.g. pharmacy name, logo, location details, etc. It gives basic background information about the pharmacy & enables the user to order prescriptions, book an online consultation & get some information about common medical conditions. I have designed it to be user friendly, visually appealing to the user & to create a positive emotional response by the user with a complimentary color palette & clickable buttons to name a few examples.  The site is targeted at current customers of the pharmacy who wish to improve their level of communication by ordering prescriptions or booking online consultations via the website & also new prospective customers that may not be aware of the pharmacy, thus improvin it's online profile.  

    The aim of the website is to:

    * clearly indicate the purpose of the website to the user
    * improve online presence of pharmacy by creating an interactive website
    * enable the user to contact the pharmacy via for specific reasons e.g. order prescription, book consultation forms
    * inform the user with information on common medical conditions
    * enable user to easily email the pharmacy by including a clickable email link 

    I plan to make the site accessable on a range of devices e.g. phone, tablet & PC/Laptop.
